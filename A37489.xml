            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Having thus taken leave of his Studies, he return'd into the Countrey to receive the plentiful proviſion his Father had by Will aſſigned him, which amounted to 4000 li. on which foundation (tho' Inconſiderable to what his elder Brother en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd) he doubted not to raiſe as Subſtantial a fortune by his Induſtrious Improvement as his Birth-right had deny'd him: With this Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, knowing the Barren Soyl of a Countrey

His Money being ſhort he was forc'd to Travel on Foot, nor had he hopes it could carry him to his Journey End, but reſolving to truſt his better fortune he ſet forward; And having Travelled three dayes ſaw the laſt penny diſpoſed of.

            <p>
               <hi>Alas Sir! ſaid</hi> Amaſius, <hi>I have long ſince known more of that affair then you are pleaſ'd to Communicate to me now; I know that</hi> Ortelia <hi>is dead, and that</hi> Amaſius <hi>can never be happy till he is ſo too; But for this I muſt blame the weakneſs of my Love, that what a Woman could do for me, I cannot for her, nor dare not, Since I am forbid all violent Remedies, which adds to my afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and prevents that Cure, which otherwiſe I would ſoon accompliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Father was ſtrangely Surpriz'd to ſee himſelf prevented in his diſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Amaſius <hi>humbly beg'd his Pardon, and aſſur'd him, it was not from his Relations or any Perſon elſe he had Entruſted with the Secret, that he came by the knowledge of it, and earneſtly pray'd him not to preſs that queſtion any farther, which if in Obedience to his Commands he ſhould be oblig'd to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, would yet add more to that weight of ſorrow he ſo miſerably labour'd under.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This made the old Gentleman his Father the more Inquiſitive, who conjur'd him by that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and duty he ow'd him as his Father, to give him a plain and Satisfactory account, which without any excuſe he immediately expected from him.</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>Some time after his Father by the Advice of his Friends, remov'd <hi>Amaſius</hi> into the Countrey, and having ſeveral Relations and acquaintance near <hi>York,</hi> that place was fixt upon, hoping that Change of Air and variety of Company might be of advantage to his Health, and a diverſion to his Melancholy. But Alas! He never En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd a Minute free from the thoughts of his fair deceaſ'd <hi>Ortelia,</hi> the only Intervals of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure he had, were when the kind Ghoſt of <hi>Orte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telia</hi> came to viſit him, which ſhe was often wont to do, or at leaſt his deluded Fancy Imagined ſo, from that time (when by the Severity of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was forc't to diſcover that he had both ſeen and diſcourſed with her the Night before the intended Marriage.) At ſeveral times would he ſtart upon a ſudden from his Company, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, do you not hear <hi>Ortelia</hi>'s voice? I come, I come, my Dear, Ah there ſhe is, pray do but obſerve how kindly the poor <hi>Ortelia</hi> looks on her <hi>Amaſius,</hi> ſee how Melancholy and pale ſhe is, how beautifully ſorrowful ſhe Glances at me, Oh my Dear I come, but when ſhall I come, never

And then retireing into the next Room, would talk with the ſame paſſionate Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Love and tenderneſs to her, as if he did really Converſe with her in the viſible form of Fleſh and Blood. Thus did he paſs away about half a year, when one Night after he had been walking and diſcourſing with her for at leaſt two Hours (tho' at all theſe ſeveral times ſhe was never ſeen by any Perſon but himſelf, ſometimes indeed they could diſtinguiſh two ſeveral Voices) when returning to his Friends more pleaſant and Merry then ever he had been before, I thank Heaven, ſayes he, my ſorrows have now found a period; I have but few nights more to repoſe on Earth, and then ſhall I live with my <hi>Ortelia,</hi> and enjoy Eternal Reſt of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

That Night he Slept heartily and next Morning aroſe early in a moſt Serene and Compoſ'd Temper, at which his Friends were extreamly pleaſed, and tho' they were much Surpriz'd at the diſcourſe of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Death, yet ſeeing him continue ſo well for three dayes, they began to forget their fears, and pleaſe themſelves with the vain hopes of his perfect recovery. The next day being <hi>Thurſday,</hi> and Bowling-day, it was agreed they
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:105739:33"/> ſhould take their Horſes and Ride to the Green, and there Dine with other Gentlemen who uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Met there once a Week: <hi>Amaſius</hi> chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully conſented to it, which was the more taken Notice of, it being the firſt time they could ever prevail with him to go into a publick Company, or divert himſelf with any Sociable Recreation. After Dinner they Bowl'd again, when a diſpute ariſing about a Caſt, <hi>Amaſius</hi> took his friends part, at which his Adverſary was ſo Incenſed (being a Cholerick Perſon) that he ſtruck him with his fiſt, but the Gentlemen who were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent interpoſeing they prevented any farther Miſchief. <hi>Amaſius,</hi> who diſdain'd to receive ſo publick an Injury with the patience of a coward, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

After he was arriv'd to more Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural years, his Father brought him up to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and enter'd him into the Society of <hi>Grayes</hi>-Inn, where he not ſo much deſign'd him for a profound Lawyer, as to be Capable to ſerve his Country in that Station and Quality he was born in.

A ſhort time after the Wedding, he ask'd her what reaſon ſhe imagin'd more particularly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced him to Love her, when ſhe could not Gueſs, he told her, it was for her ſtrict Vertue and Chaſtity, for he had made a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution never to Marry any whom he could

In this Interval the Uncle ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving uſed all the probable means for a diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that humane Wit could imagine, but not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to make any, began to think what was to be done, the time of the Aſſize drew on, and then he ſhould certainly be Indicted for the Murder of <hi>Joanna,</hi> nor had he any way to clear his Innocence againſt ſuch Circumſtantial E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, but by a down-right Negation, which though ſome of his Friends might Credit, would yet take no place in a Court of Judicature. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus conſidered the difficulty of his Caſe, he at laſt reſolved thus. In his ſearch after <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anna,</hi> he had found a poor Mans Daughter in another County, who both in Age, Features<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

A day or two before the Aſſize, he gave out he had by great fortune found his Neece, brings her home to his Houſe with her real Father and Mother, who gave a Satisfactory account to all perſons how acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently they found her in a wood almoſt Starv'd, and She not remembring from whence She had wandred they Entertained her amongſt their own Children. The Girl own'd how ſhe Stole away for fear her Uncle ſhould whip her again as he threatned, all which Romance hung ſo well together, that the Guardians believ'd her the ſame, and no body queſtion'd the truth. At the Aſſize he was calld to appear which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly he did, the Judge asked him for his Neece <hi>Joanna</hi> if ſhe was found yet, <hi>Yes, my Lord,</hi> ſayes

Yes, my Lord,</hi> ſaid the Guardians, After a farther account how ſhe was found the Judge order'd their Recognizance ſhould be withdrawn, and the Uncle diſcharged. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that an old Woman who was in Court about other buſineſs, hearing what a Buſtle had been made about her young Miſtreſs, and that ſhe was found again, as they came out of Court crowded to ſee her, and looking full up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her, believed it to be the ſame, but the Girl not taking Notice of her, She cryed out, <hi>O Miſtreſs you don't know Me,</hi> upon which She anſwer'd preſently, no, what ſayes She, don't you know old Nurſe? I am ſure you are not the ſame then, upon this the Girl was ſtartled, the Guardians made a ſtop and asked her how ſhe came to forget Nurſe ſo ſoon, ſhe not give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a preſent anſwer, they began to ſuſpect ſomething and brought her again into Court and Nurſe with her.</p>
            <p>The old Woman ſaid, <hi>She did believe
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:105739:58"/> it had been the ſame at firſt, but upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view ſhe much queſtion'd it, that ſhe her ſelf had Nurſt her till ſhe was almoſt four years old, and if it was her Miſtreſs ſhe had a Scar upon her left Arm above the Elbow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Judge ordered they ſhould look upon her Arm, which they did, and reported there was no Scar above but one below the Elbow, upon this it was generally believ'd ſhe was the lame, and all things ſet right again. However the Judge ſeem'd more diſatisfied then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ordered the Uncle to withdraw, and examined the Girl, Afterwards the Man apart, who ſaid he had found her in a Wood, and then the woman, and here he found they all diſagreed in one point or other, at length by croſsing the account of the Man and Wife, and then conſidering that both the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians and Nurſe agreed the true <hi>Joanna,</hi> muſt needs have remembred her Nurſe, ſince it was not a Twelve-Month ago ſince ſhe ſaw and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly knew her, they agreed it was yet a Cheat, which the Woman for fear of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, firſt Confeſt, and then her husband own'd it, and laſtly the Girl; They proved the Receit of ſo much Money at ſuch a time, proved by ſeveral neighbours, who had known this Girl
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:105739:58"/> for five or ſix years together, that ſhe alwayes was look'd upon and reputed as their own Child and alwayes liv'd with them. Upon this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery an Indictment was preferr'd againſt the Uncle, for the Murder of his Neece <hi>Joanna,</hi> but he having no proof to clear himſelf by, and this appearing with ſo foul a Face againſt him, he was Condemn'd to be hang'd, and was within a Week after Executed.

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the Judge ordered them to be ſoundly laſh'd for Vagrants, and ſent out of Town, as the Conſtable was taking them away, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman who was the Judges Son, call'd out Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſely to the Conſtable, pray favour the black-woman, for ſhe tells me, I ſhall Marry a Gipſie within theſe three Months; which his Father overhearing call'd them back again, and ask'd them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And if amongſt thoſe Thouſands who were ready to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice their bleeding hearts to the fair <hi>Orithia,</hi> any was thought to have a more particular intereſt in her Favour, it was the Lovely <hi>Philanthus,</hi> who was only
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:105739:61"/> able to make a Repriſall of Hearts amongſt the Ladies, for thoſe <hi>Orithia</hi> Captivated from the Men. <hi>Philanthus</hi> his Family was ſomewhat inferiour, but much more Opulent, he being the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Branch of it, who for the great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his Father, (who loſt his Life in the Wars againſt the <hi>French</hi>) had the Honour of Knight-hood Confer'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, whilſt yet a School-boy, by his Gracious Prince. The Aſſiduous Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of <hi>Philanthus,</hi> his kind Reception, and more intimate familiarity oblig'd us all to believe he would be that happy Conquerour, who ſhould carry off this Noble prize from the Reſt of the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing world. But amongſt thoſe Stars which influence the great affairs of Love, ſome are kind and propitious, whilſt others infect their good intents by their poyſonous Neighbourhood, ſome ſuch unhappy Conjunction there was which ſuddenly blaſted <hi>Philanthus</hi> his blooming hopes, rob'd him of all his
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:105739:62"/> Glorious Expectations and left him the Pity or the Scorn of his Rivals.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Count de Montallo</hi> who was Ambaſſadour from the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> at the Engliſh Court, being ſhortly to return, and having often admired the Beautifull <hi>Orithia,</hi> as the moſt lovely Creature his Eyes yet beheld, made his private Addreſſes to her, and without the knowledge or Conſent of her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations was Married to her.</p>
            <p>My Lord, her Father, and all her Friends were extreamly concern'd at it, there not being any but who gave <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanthus</hi> the Encouragement to hope he ſhould be that happy Perſon, nor had he any reaſon to queſtion <hi>Orithia's</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, till the Count made his applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and then the Ambition of being ſo great a Counteſs ſoon prevail'd over the more eaſy powers of Love. Within four days after, <hi>Orithia</hi> went along with the Count her Husband for <hi>Savoy,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeeing or taking leave of any of her
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:105739:62"/> Friends or Relations. This ſudden Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with the Count had at firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly incenſed my Lord her Father, but conſidering ſhe had Honourably diſpoſed her ſelf, without the Charge of a weighty portion, which his Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances could not ſo conveniently ſpare, he now called that prudence and diſcretion, which before he thought a raſh and inconſiderable Action. After her Arrival at <hi>Savoy,</hi> for three years ſhe liv'd as happy &amp; as great as heart could wiſh, the Count her Husband lov'd her above all the World, and his Eſtate, which was very conſiderable, was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely at her Command. No Empreſs, tho' ſhe might have more large Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, was better belov'd, or more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly obeyed then ſhe was. It happened that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> making Wars upon ſome of the Neighbouring Princes appointed the <hi>Count de Montallo</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of his Army, which was an Honour he could not refuſe, though with ſome
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:105739:63"/> regret he parted from the Arms of his beloved <hi>Orithia.</hi> That he might leave the affairs of his Family under the better Government, he appointed three of his Friends as Commiſſioners to take an account of his Rents, aſſiſt the Counteſs upon all occaſion with their Advice, and manage all his buſineſs to his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt advantage and reputation. To theſe he added one more, who was the honeſt <hi>Sabrino</hi> as he uſed to call him, a Gentleman of ſome Relation to the Count, but his intimate Friend and Confident. The Duke being now with his Army, and not expected back till a peace was concluded, which was yet but uncertainly diſcourſ'd; <hi>Sabrino,</hi> who had the largeſt Commiſſion of any of the reſt, and much more reſpected, conſidered that this was the only oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity his heart could wiſh for, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat thoſe deſires he had ſo long lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed under. Accordingly one day coming up to the Counteſs, as if upon
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:105739:63"/> ſome Urgent buſineſs, he found her alone in her Cloſet, where without any regard to the Honour of the Count, the Vertue of the Lady, which he had no reaſon to ſuſpect, or to the Modeſty and good manners in himſelf, of which he ought to have had ſome ſhare, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd his unlawfull paſſion, which ſhe received with that abhorrence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation that he was well aſſured he was now undone for ever, if he did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve himſelf by being the firſt Accuſer, tho' he had nothing to Charge the ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>Orithia</hi> with, but what was falſe as Hell or Devils could invent. However envenom'd malice will want neither Inſtruments or Methods to perfect its Revenge; tho' what wrong had <hi>Sabrino</hi> received? He firſt gives the affront, and then demands Satisfaction, and firſt Tempts the Lady with his laſcivious addreſs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:105739:64"/> are wicked and debauch'd. <hi>Sabrino,</hi> that he might loſe no opportunity, ſent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to the three Commiſſioners to meet him at his own Chamber, where he told them,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He had a ſecret of that importance to communicate to them and of that ſtrange Surprize, that he wanted words to expreſs the preſent Horrour of his thoughts; I have for ſome time ſuſpected, and I wiſh I could ſay I did yet but ſuſpect, Oh ſhall I ſpeak it! The Fidelity and Chaſtity of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs</hi>— upon which one of them told him, Sir, I will as ſoon beleive, the Glorious Cherubins may be tainted in their pure Angelic Natures, as that any Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of diſhoneſty hath or ever ſhall aſſoil the Vertue of that immaculate Lady. <hi>Oh Sir, ſayes</hi> Sabrino, <hi>be not too forward I once thought ſo too, but I am afraid I ſhall be able to convince you ſooner then you or I could wiſh for.

               <hi>Sabrino</hi> had a Nephew a proper young Gentleman, who had been Page to the <hi>Count</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and ſince his return, was prefer'd to be Gentleman Uſher to the Counteſs; This Gentleman he ſent for privately to his Chamber, and told him he underſtood what a particular kindneſs the Counteſs had for him, and that now was the time for him to make his fortunes in the abſence of his Lord The young Gentleman told him he did not underſtand his meaning; O Nephew (ſaid he) are you ſo ſhort ſighted, why the Counteſs is in love with you above all the World, and wants nothing but an opportunity, to compleat yours and her own happineſs in Bed, which I have promiſed her this Night: Wherefore you muſt in the Evening pretend to go Sick to Bed, and then undreſs to you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y Lodg'd under the Bed, and a little before the Counteſs went to her Chamber, ſent for the Commiſſioners, and told them, <hi>he was inform'd that the Counteſs's Gallant was to be with her that Night, but who he was that he could not tell; Sabrino</hi> and the reſt concluded to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſome extraordinary buſineſs, to be diſpatched that Night and to deſire to ſpeak with her as ſoon as her Women had left her, and then if there was any
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:105739:65"/> Gallant, they ſhould certainly diſcover him, if not give the Counteſs no reaſon to ſuſpect their deſign, Accordingly they did ſo, and coming ſoftly up ſtairs knock'd at her Chamber door, an old Gentlewoman (who had formerly been her Nurſe) lay in the Chamber with her and was going in to Bed, when ſhe heard ſome Body knock at the Chamber door, She asked who was there, And their buſineſs, to which one of them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

She acquainted the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs with what they ſaid, who ordered her to let them in. As they were by her Bed-ſide diſcourſing with her, <hi>Sabrino</hi> cryes out, <hi>I, here he is, here's the Rogue, and pulls his Nephew by the heels from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Bed, and calling him Rogue, Villain and Traytor, to abuſe ſo good a Lord,</hi> ſtruck him through the heart with his Sword,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:105739:66"/> before he could ſpeak one word to Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate himſelf or his Ladies Honour. It was now in vain for the Counteſs to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to purge her ſelf from a Crime which appeared againſt her by ſo Noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious an Evidence, tho' ſhe did in the preſence of ſeveral Worthy perſons take the Sacrament upon it, that as ſhe never had been Guilty againſt her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands Bed, ſo ſhe knew nothing of that Perſons being there; that it was all the malicious Contrivance of <hi>Sabrino</hi> (whoſe unlawful deſires ſhe had refuſed with Scorn and contempt) that had now plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this Revenge to Rob her of her life and Honour at the ſame time. This ſome believ'd, who thought the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs to be as uncorrupt as Vertue it ſelf. But others ſaid here's plain demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt her, and ſhe who dares com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Adultery, will not ſtick at a lye to defend her Guilt. The Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners writ a Letter to the Count to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with this unhappy News, in

The Counteſs was highly ſenſible of this as the greateſt affliction that ever befell her, yet her own Innocence, and the Satisfaction that aroſe from thence made the diſtreſs much more eaſy and ſupportable. The Count was ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

She now conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the ſmall remainder of her Life would ſoon be gone, and unleſs ſome Gentleman would Entertain ſuch Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:105739:67"/> thoughts of her, as to believe her Guiltleſs, and Engage his Life to preſerve hers, ſhe muſt certainly ſuffer, and as no Perſon had yet offer'd himſelf, ſo was ſhe altogether at a loſs where to find that Gallant Friend. At laſt amongſt other Engliſh Gentlemen who had been formerly her Friends and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, She fixt upon <hi>Philanthus,</hi> but at the ſame time Corrected her Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in thinking that he who believed himſelf the moſt diſobliged of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, ſhould now hazard his Life to Vindicate her Reputation, No, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he would be pleaſ'd to hear of her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, and rejoyce to ſee her proud heart now humbled under the deepeſt afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but on the other Hand conſidering him as a Gentleman, a Perſon of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Courage and Gallantry, and one whoſe former affections were moſt ſincerely devoted to her Service, he would rather Court ſuch an opportunity to lay an everlaſting obligation on her
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:105739:68"/> which all her Treaſury of thanks and Gratitude ſhould be too poor to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. And this took place in her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution; Accordingly She writ a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Philanthus,</hi> and ſent it by a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who had been formerly her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, with orders where to find or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire for him at <hi>London,</hi> and to deliver him that Letter, receive his Anſwer, and return with all ſpeed. <hi>Philanthus</hi> who had ſtill the ſame reſpect and love for <hi>Orithia</hi> as would conſiſt with Honour, having read the Letter, was extreamly troubled at it, but at the ſame time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ruin'd himſelf in his Fortunes, his mind ſunk under the load of miſeries which oppreſt him, writ back a moſt paſſionate Letter of excuſe, with wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ch ſhe was no leſs affected as well for his as her own ſake. <hi>Orithia</hi> Spent her ſhort time (which now wanted but a week of the fatal day) in recommending her Soul to Heaven, wholly deſpairing of any relief on Earth. <hi>Philanthus</hi> having
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:105739:68"/> ſince ſeriouſly conſidered the preſent diſtreſs of the Counteſs, and that ſhe muſt for ever ſuffer in her Memory, which to all Noble Spirits is Ten times worſe then a Thouſand deaths, and that though in his excuſe to her he had not put his own intereſt or buſineſs into the Scale to ballance againſt her Life and Honour; But that ſtrange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected diſaſters had reduced him to that mean degree of want that he was not able to Equip himſelf for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; Yet this from a Generous Spirit was mean and pitifull, that however his Friends would not aſſiſt him here, he could want nothing there of Horſe or Arms a <hi>Cavalier</hi> could ask. After he had ponder'd a while on this thought he went to a Gentleman of his intimate acquaintance, ſhow'd him the Letter, and beg'd of him to furniſh him with Moneys for that deſign which he did, and <hi>Philanthus</hi> a ſhort time after went privately over to <hi>Savoy.</hi> Being arrived

He ſtayed with her three Hours, and was as well ſatisfi'd of her Innocency and <hi>Sabrino's</hi> Roguery as his heart could wiſh.

The next Morning at Nine of the Clock the Counteſs all in white, was brought from the Nunnery into a fair adjacent plain, in the middle of which was fixt a Stake, with a great deal of dryed Wood and other Combuſtible Matter.
